![Photon Firmware](photon-firmware.png)

Photon is Open-Source firmware for pick and place feeders.

A feeder is a small machine that moves component tape very small, precise increments in order to automatically serve up new components to a pick and place machine.

Photon was originally developed as part of the LumenPnP project, but it is designed to support many types of hardware.

## Picking a Release

If you're looking to update to the latest stable release, use the release tagged `Latest`. Do NOT use a `Pre-Release` firmware, or one with `rc` in the name. We release lots of Release Candidate (denoted with an `rc` in the version name) firmware builds that are still being tested. If you're interested in testing the latest build, then the `rc` fimware is for you!
